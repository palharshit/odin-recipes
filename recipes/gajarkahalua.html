    <h2>Description </h2>
   <h4> Gajar ka halwa, also known as  gajar pak and carrot halwa is a carrot-based 
    sweet dessert pudding made by placing grated carrots in a pot containing a specific 
    amount of water, milk and sugar, cardamom and then cooking while stirring regularly.
     It is often served with a garnish of almonds and pistachios. The nuts and 
    other items used are first sautéed in ghee, a type of clarified butter </h4>
    <h2><u>Ingredients</u></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>carrot</li>
        <li>250 gm sugar</li>
        <li>2 lit Milk</li>
        <li>100 gm cardamom</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Heat 6 tablespoons ghee in a deep bottomed heavy pan or kadai. Add 9 cups tightly packed grated carrots.</li>
        <li>On a low heat, sauté carrots in ghee, stirring often until they turn tender and are cooked – about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li> Add 2 cups of crumbled or grated khoya</li>
        <li>First mix thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Then add 1 to 1.25 cups sugar. Adjust the amount of sugar depending upon the sweetness of your khoya. If your khoya is sweet, start with just 1 cup of sugar.</li>
        <li>Combine and mix well. </li>
        <li>You will see that both the khoya and sugar will melt.</li>
        <li>Now add ⅓ cup of cashews, ⅓ cup golden raisins, 1 tablespoon pistachios (chopped) and 1.5 to 2 teaspoons cardamom powder.</li>
        <li>Mix again and, stirring often, simmer gajar halwa on low heat. The halwa will start thickening, reducing and leave the edges of the pan. When you see these signs, switch off the heat</li>
        <li>Serve gajar ka halwa either warm or chilled. </li>
       
    </ol>
